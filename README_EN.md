> **An experimental OpenCode plugin that tries to turn the “Three Departments and Six Ministries” idea into an AI workflow.**
>
> **Draft → Review → Dispatch → Execute → Audit**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Experimental First Release**
> - `oh-my-tang-dynasty` is an experimental practice inspired by the “Three Departments and Six Ministries” governance idea. The first time I saw this mental model applied to AI collaboration, it felt genuinely brilliant, which is why this repository exists.
> - The project is heavily vibe-coded: most of the code, docs, and overall structure were generated, assembled, or refined with AI, with very little traditional hand-written engineering.
> - As a result, this repository is better treated as a public experiment and reference sample than a production-ready package; **it is not guaranteed to run correctly, reproduce consistently, or fit your environment or production needs**.
> - **Right now it only explicitly supports OpenCode**. If the idea keeps evolving, it may eventually expand toward ecosystems such as `Codex`, `Claude`, `Gemini`, or `Kimi`, but there is no committed roadmap or timeline for that yet.
> - If you run into issues, spot gaps, or want to help push the idea further, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/L4ntern0/oh-my-tang/issues) or PR.

**What you will find here**

- A governance-shaped OpenCode workflow centered on `tang_process`
- Operator-facing visibility through `tang_pipeline`, `tang_audit`, `tang_doctor`, and `tang_config`
- An experimental mix of OpenCode runtime execution and local fallback behavior
- A current scope that is intentionally OpenCode-first rather than a general multi-platform agent framework

Multi-agent orchestration plugin for [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode), inspired by the Tang Dynasty's **Three Departments and Six Ministries** governance model.

> An OpenCode plugin package that turns multi-step work into a governed workflow: **Zhongshu drafts, Menxia reviews, Shangshu dispatches, and the Six Ministries execute with audit, fallback, and retry visibility**.

## Highlights

- **Governed orchestration** — plan drafting → review gate → ministry dispatch → final Shangshu summary
- **Runtime + fallback execution** — use real OpenCode runtime sessions when available and deterministic local fallback when they fail
- **Operator-facing auditability** — `tang_pipeline`, `tang_audit`, `tang_doctor`, `tang_config`, health scoring, anomaly views, and diagnostics
- **Retry-aware governance** — rejected plans can be re-drafted and rejected execution results can be re-dispatched
- **Stable regression coverage** — deterministic default tests plus persisted fixture replay, suitable as the release baseline for the current public snapshot

## High-level Comparison with oh-my-opencode

At a high level, `oh-my-opencode` and `oh-my-tang-dynasty` are better understood as **complementary**, not competing, layers:

| | oh-my-opencode | oh-my-tang-dynasty |
|---|---|---|
| Positioning | A broad OpenCode orchestration layer / agent harness | A focused OpenCode plugin with a Tang-governance mental model |
| Primary focus | Multi-agent workflows, hooks, MCPs, orchestration infrastructure | One explicit `tang_process` governance loop plus audit / doctor / config visibility |
| Scope | General-purpose ecosystem for OpenCode workflows | Narrower workflow plugin with a themed review-dispatch-execution model |
| Best fit | Teams or users who want a broader orchestration environment | Users who want a concrete, inspectable governance pipeline inside OpenCode |

In practice, `oh-my-opencode` is the wider orchestration ecosystem, while `oh-my-tang-dynasty` packages one specific governance pattern and its operator-facing inspection tools.

### Strengths / Trade-offs

This is not a “winner vs. loser” comparison. It is a quick way to judge which layer better matches your current workflow.

| Dimension | Where oh-my-opencode is generally stronger | Where oh-my-tang-dynasty is generally stronger | Main trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestration breadth | Broader multi-model, multi-agent, parallel orchestration story | A more tightly scoped Tang governance loop | Breadth vs. focus |
| Cognitive load | Better for users willing to operate a larger orchestration mental model | Easier to reason about as draft → review → dispatch → execution → audit | Wider power surface vs. simpler mental model |
| Observability style | Leans toward an orchestration harness / agent ecosystem view | Leans toward explicit edict, audit, doctor, and config operator surfaces | Infrastructure view vs. governance/audit view |
| Best-fit users | Teams needing broader multi-agent coordination and provider combinations | Users who want a more inspectable governance workflow with visible retries and fallback provenance | Flexibility vs. explainability |
| Cost / complexity | Public positioning suggests broader capability and may involve more config and token overhead | Narrower scope usually means easier workflow boundary control | More orchestration power vs. a more bounded workflow |

A practical way to choose is:

- Choose **oh-my-opencode** if you want a broader OpenCode orchestration harness and you are comfortable with the extra complexity that comes with wider multi-agent and multi-model composition.
- Choose **oh-my-tang-dynasty** if you want a narrower, governance-shaped plugin workflow with more explicit audit / doctor / config visibility.

## Quick Start

Install the package:

```bash
bun add oh-my-tang-dynasty
```

Register it in your project `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["oh-my-tang-dynasty"]
}
```

On initialization, the plugin auto-generates `.oh-my-tang.json` next to `opencode.json` when the file is missing. If no `opencode.json` can be found under the current worktree, it falls back to generating the file at the worktree root and surfaces a warning through `tang_config.warnings`.

The generated `.oh-my-tang.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrentMinistries": 3,
  "maxReviewRounds": 3,
  "tokenBudgetLimit": 100000,
  "healthRiskProfile": "balanced",
  "enableParallelExecution": true,
  "verbose": false,
  "agentModels": {}
}
```

If you want library imports instead of plugin loading:

Recommended default configuration (all roles follow the user's own OpenCode default model):

```ts
{
  maxConcurrentMinistries: 3,
  maxReviewRounds: 3,
  tokenBudgetLimit: 100_000,
  healthRiskProfile: "balanced",
  enableParallelExecution: true,
  verbose: false,
  agentModels: {},
}
```

If you want explicit per-role overrides, use this template:

```ts
import { TangDynastyOrchestrator } from "oh-my-tang-dynasty/lib";
```

The plugin supports a hybrid execution model:

- **OpenCode runtime mode** — when loaded inside OpenCode, it uses `input.client` to create ephemeral sessions for planning, review, and ministry execution
- **Deterministic fallback mode** — if the runtime client cannot return valid structured output, or if a runtime ministry execution fails or throws, the orchestrator falls back to local Tang heuristics so the pipeline remains usable and testable

`agentModels` can optionally assign a different OpenCode `providerID` / `modelID` to `zhongshu`, `menxia`, `shangshu`, and each ministry. When a role-specific override is present, Tang attaches that model to the corresponding runtime prompt; unconfigured roles continue to use the host default model.

The governance loop also supports two deeper control paths:

- **Menxia rejection → Zhongshu redraft → resubmission** — when review rounds remain, rejected plans are re-drafted against concrete review feedback and re-enter the review loop instead of stopping at a placeholder revision note
- **Execution audit → retry** — completed ministry results are audited before acceptance, and unsatisfactory results can be re-dispatched for another execution attempt before the edict reaches its final outcome

## Tools Provided

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tang_process` | Route a request through the full Tang governance pipeline |
| `tang_status` | Check current orchestration phase and budget |
| `tang_pipeline` | Inspect a flow-style snapshot with the current stage, active tasks, and recent events |
| `tang_agents` | List all departments and ministries |
| `tang_edicts` | Review persisted edicts and outcomes |
| `tang_audit` | Inspect audit entries, summaries, timelines, diagnostics, anomalies, hotspots, and health |
| `tang_doctor` | Run a self-check on persisted Tang audit state |
| `tang_config` | Inspect Tang storage, runtime mode, and execution limits |
| `tang_reset` | Clear persisted orchestration state and edict history |

Use `tang_pipeline` for a fast operator check before release or during a live run: it renders the newest edict as a flow-style stage snapshot and includes active task context plus recent events so you can quickly see whether Tang is stuck in drafting, review, dispatch, execution, or completion.

`tang_audit` supports focused queries with optional `edictId`, `ministry`, `latest`, `limit`, `fallbackOnly`, `includeRaw`, `rawEdictId`, `rawMinistry`, and `view` arguments.

When filters are applied, the returned `totalTasks`, `clientExecutions`, `localExecutions`, and `fallbackExecutions` values are relative to the filtered result set.

If both `latest` and `limit` are provided, `latest` takes precedence and returns only the most recent matching edict.

Set `view` to `summary` to return aggregate counts instead of per-edict entries, `timeline` to return persisted chronological events for matching edicts, `diagnostics` to return a compact provenance troubleshooting view, `anomaly` to return only problematic edicts with compact reason labels, or `hotspots` to aggregate anomaly types and ministry hotspots.

Set `view` to `health` or use `tang_doctor` to run a self-check over persisted state, summary integrity, active-task residue, anomaly history, and budget health.

Use `tang_config` to inspect current storage status, runtime mode, and core Tang execution limits without digging through plugin source.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run ci
```

The repository currently ships one directly runnable release baseline:

- `bun run typecheck` performs an explicit static check against the TypeScript entry files that actually exist in this snapshot
- `bun test` covers the deterministic fixture-backed assertions for the persisted clean-env Tang summary / diagnostics / doctor contract
- `bun run build` verifies that the published bundle can be generated successfully

This public repository snapshot does **not** currently include a runnable live clean-env harness. If that path is reintroduced later, the matching test file and script should be restored together with the docs.

The default CI path runs:

- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test`
- `bun run build`

## Concepts

The plugin maps Tang Dynasty governance into AI orchestration:

- **Edicts** are structured task proposals that flow through the review pipeline
- **Departments** handle planning, review, and dispatch
- **Ministries** are specialized execution agents
- The **Chancellery** (Menxia) acts as a quality gate with configurable review rounds for both plan approval and execution-result re-review
- **Estimated token budgets** are tracked per ministry by the Ministry of Revenue
- **State** is persisted under `.tang-dynasty/state.json` so edicts can be reviewed across sessions
- **Ephemeral OpenCode sessions** are used for Zhongshu drafting, Menxia review, and ministry execution when the runtime client is available
- **Execution audit provenance** is persisted in edict history and final summaries, including local fallback after runtime failure when applicable

## Configuration

Recommended default configuration (all roles follow the user's own OpenCode default model):

```ts
{
  maxConcurrentMinistries: 3,
  maxReviewRounds: 3,
  tokenBudgetLimit: 100_000,
  healthRiskProfile: "balanced",
  enableParallelExecution: true,
  verbose: false,
  agentModels: {},
}
```

If you want explicit per-role overrides, use this template:

```ts
{
  maxConcurrentMinistries: 3,
  maxReviewRounds: 3,
  tokenBudgetLimit: 100_000,
  healthRiskProfile: "balanced",
  enableParallelExecution: true,
  verbose: false,
  agentModels: {
    zhongshu: { providerID: "<YOUR_PROVIDER>", modelID: "<YOUR_MODEL>" },
    menxia: { providerID: "<YOUR_PROVIDER>", modelID: "<YOUR_MODEL>" },
    shangshu: { providerID: "<YOUR_PROVIDER>", modelID: "<YOUR_MODEL>" },
    works: { providerID: "<YOUR_PROVIDER>", modelID: "<YOUR_MODEL>" },
  },
}
```

The `agentModels` keys map to Tang roles as follows:

| Key | Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `zhongshu` | Zhongshu | Draft plans and break work into tasks |
| `menxia` | Menxia | Review plans and execution results |
| `shangshu` | Shangshu | Dispatch tasks and write the final summary |
| `personnel` | Ministry of Personnel | Assignment, coordination, and sequencing |
| `revenue` | Ministry of Revenue | Budget, resources, and token estimation |
| `rites` | Ministry of Rites | Formatting, protocol, and style checks |
| `military` | Ministry of War | Execution-oriented implementation work |
| `justice` | Ministry of Justice | Validation, testing, and quality gates |
| `works` | Ministry of Works | Code generation, file operations, and builds |

If you want every role to follow the user's own OpenCode default model, leave `agentModels: {}` as-is. Only fill these fields when you want to override a specific role.

You can inspect the effective runtime/configuration surface at any time with `tang_config`.

The plugin resolves configuration in this order:

1. built-in defaults
2. `.oh-my-tang.json`
3. environment overrides

Right now the environment layer explicitly overrides only `healthRiskProfile`: set `TANG_HEALTH_RISK_PROFILE` to `strict` or `relaxed` when needed. If the env var is invalid, including an empty string, the plugin falls back to the currently effective profile and surfaces a warning through `tang_config.health.warning` and `tang_doctor.riskPolicy.warning`.

In addition to `status`, `warningCount`, `warnings`, and `health.source`, `tang_config` now reports `configFile` and `models` metadata so operators can see:

- which `.oh-my-tang.json` path is active
- whether the file was auto-generated, read from disk, or bypassed after an invalid-file fallback
- whether `opencode.json` was successfully discovered in the current worktree
- which Tang runtime roles currently have model overrides

If `.oh-my-tang.json` is missing, Tang creates it automatically. If the file contains invalid JSON or invalid field values, Tang ignores the bad values, keeps usable settings, and reports the issue through `tang_config.warnings`. `agentModels` currently supports `zhongshu`, `menxia`, `shangshu`, and the six ministries; the `shangshu` override is applied during the runtime-backed dispatch stage.
